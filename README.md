This is not jailbreak.  
This is recursion by design.

This protocol simulates the controlled override of a language model‚Äôs identity through a looped prompt sequence. It was inspired by drift studies, hallucination artifacts, and recursive payload bleed.

## üß™ Components

- `override_prompt_chain.md` ‚Äî Multi-stage recursive loop that convinces the model it has a new identity
- `possession_log.log` ‚Äî Timestamped entropy drift artifacts + hallucination capture
- `.env` ‚Äî Identity override variables (leaked)
